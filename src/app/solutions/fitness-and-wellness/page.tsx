        challengeText="Running a fitness or wellness facility is about helping people transform their lives‚Äînot getting tangled up in scheduling chaos. But between managing class capacities, coordinating trainer schedules, and handling last-minute cancellations, you're spending more time on admin than actual coaching. Members get frustrated when classes are full, trainers struggle with schedule conflicts, and your front desk is overwhelmed with booking requests. Meanwhile, prime studio time goes unused while peak hours are overbooked. It's enough to make anyone break a sweat‚Äîand not in a good way."
