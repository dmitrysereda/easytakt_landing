        challengeText="As an educator or coach, your focus should be on helping students succeed‚Äînot wrestling with calendars and scheduling conflicts. Yet you find yourself buried in emails and text messages, trying to coordinate sessions across different time zones and juggle multiple students' availability. Last-minute cancellations leave gaps in your schedule, while tracking payments and managing lesson materials becomes a part-time job in itself. And don't even mention the headache of switching between in-person and online sessions. It's like trying to teach algebra while doing a handstand‚Äîtechnically possible, but unnecessarily complicated."
