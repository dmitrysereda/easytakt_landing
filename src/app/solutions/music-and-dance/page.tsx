        challengeText="Managing a music or dance school is like conducting an orchestra‚Äîevery element needs to be perfectly synchronized. Between coordinating private lessons, group classes, and studio space, traditional scheduling methods fall flat. Teachers struggle with last-minute cancellations, while parents and students get frustrated with inflexible booking systems. Practice rooms sit empty during prime times, yet get double-booked during peak hours. And keeping track of student progress across multiple instructors? That's a dance nobody wants to do."
