Yet here you are, dealing with a constant stream of phone calls during treatments, trying to coordinate stylist schedules on paper, and losing revenue to no-shows. Your team gets overwhelmed with last-minute changes, while clients get frustrated when they can't book their favorite stylist outside business hours. The result? Double-booked chairs, unhappy clients, and a scheduling system that's more complicated than a multi-step hair color process."
